Ravens Progression AI

Overview

Ravens Progression AI is a machine learning project designed to analyze and simulate progression patterns using advanced algorithms. This project is inspired by Raven's Progressive Matrices, aiming to study and replicate progression patterns effectively.

Features

Pattern Recognition: Identifies progression patterns in data sets.

Customizable Models: Supports different machine learning frameworks.

Data Visualization: Offers tools to visualize progression patterns.

Scalability: Optimized for large datasets and complex models.

AI Agent for Problem Solving: A specialized AI agent designed to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices by analyzing visual and logical patterns.

AI Agent Overview

Purpose of the AI Agent

The AI agent is the core of this project and is specifically designed to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices, a type of visual puzzle used to test abstract reasoning. The agent uses image processing and logical reasoning to determine the correct answer by analyzing the relationships and transformations between visual figures.

Core Methods and Workflow

1. Initialization

__init__ Method:

Initializes the agent with required libraries and configurations.

Prepares the agent to process image-based puzzles.

2. Solving Problems

Solve(problem) Method:

The primary entry point for the agent to solve a given puzzle.

Determines whether the problem is a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix.

Calls helper methods to analyze transformations and relationships between figures.

3. Image Comparison and Transformation

Image Processing Methods:

checkSame: Compares two images pixel-by-pixel to measure similarity.

checkMirrorHoriz and checkMirrorVert: Detects horizontal and vertical mirroring transformations by flipping the images.

checkRotate90 and checkRotate270: Identifies rotational transformations by rotating the images by 90° or 270° and comparing them.

Transformational Methods:

checkAdd: Detects added elements between two images using image subtraction and comparison.

checkDelete: Identifies removed elements by reversing the addition logic.

4. Transformation Mapping

getAllTransforms(problem) Method:

Analyzes transformations between all possible pairs of figures (e.g., A → B, A → C).

Returns a dictionary of transformations for further analysis.

5. Optimal Solution Selection

getHeroTransform(all_trans) Method:

Combines and evaluates all possible transformations to determine the "hero transformation," or the best match for solving the puzzle.

Uses weighted scoring to rank and select the most likely solution based on transformation similarities.

Example Workflow

Load a Problem:
The agent begins by receiving a problem object containing figures (e.g., A, B, C, and possible answers).

Analyze Transformations:
It computes transformations between pairs of figures, such as rotations, mirrors, or additions.

Compare Patterns:
The agent compares transformations between the given figures and the answer choices.

Select the Best Match:
Based on the highest scoring transformation, the agent returns the most probable answer.

Example Code

To use the agent to solve a problem:

from agent import Agent

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent()

# Solve a specific problem
solution = agent.Solve(problem)
print("Solution:", solution)
